        <h3>KERAFLO TYPE K</h3>
        <p>The 'Type K' pictured here is suitable for tanks with or without raised valve housings and is ideal for
            pumped water lines (e.g. rainwater). The puncture-proof float eliminates stress on the tank wall and gives
            precise hammer-free opening and closing. The 'up and over' discharge facilites air-gap compliance.Available
            in sizes from 1/2” to 2″ bsp.</p>

        <h3>KERAFLO TYPE KB</h3>
        <p>The 'Type KB' valve provides a fully variable delayed action with precise opening and closing levels. It is
            especially suitable for use on a mains water feed into a break tank, so is ideal for rainwater harvesting
            systems of the indirect type. Fitted into an appropriate raised housing, the 'KB' type valve provides a type
            AB air gap in compliance with the Water Regulations requirements for backflow prevention.The opening and
            closing levels of the valve are infinitely variable up to 1.8 metres depth and can be adjusted quickly
            without the use of any tools.Available in sizes from 3/4” to 3″ bsp.</p>

        <img src="img/pro3.jpg" alt="overflow traps" style="width: 15rem;">
        <h3>OVERFLOW TRAPS</h3>
        <p>The Multisiphon overflow trap is a unique unit from WISY® designed specifically for use in rainwater storage
            tanks. It is fitted inside the tank and connected to a short stub pipe for joining to standard 100mm
            drain.The unit incorporates several important features:A water trap to prevent bad odours from the drainage
            system, A surface skimmer to effectively remove floating debris, A backflow prevention device, An optional
            vermin barrier. The unit is effectively a 'U' bend providing a water seal in the same way as a WC pan or
            waste trap. This acts as a barrier to unpleasant smells from the drain that connects to the overflow, which
            could otherwise taint the water. It also very effectively removes floating debris from the surface of the
            water, due to the “skimming” design of the unit at the top.The most important function, however, is to act
            as an anti-backflow device to prevent a surcharge from the drains entering back in to the tank and
            contaminating the stored water.</p>
        <hr>

        <img src="img/pro4.jpg" alt="pipe marking" style="width: 10rem;">
        <h3>PIPE MARKING</h3>
        <p>Pipes that are used to convey rainwater must be appropriately marked in order to avoid any confusion or
            cross-connection between wholesome and non-wholesome supplies.</p>
        <hr>

        <img src="img/pro5.jpg" alt="mains top-ups" style="width: 15rem;">
        <h3>MAINS TOP-UPS</h3>
        <p>Most rainwater harvesting systems require a means of switching to an alternative source, in the event of the
            system running out of rainwater. However, there are strict regulations governing the way that this is done,
            in order to eliminate any risk of non-potable water being able to siphon back into the mains supply. This is
            achieved through the use of an air gap that the mains water must pass through before entering the tank. Our
            special mains water top-up units are designed specifically for this purpose.For direct systems, where the
            mains water is fed to the rainwater tank itself, we supply a special assembly that incorporates a tundish.
            This provides the necessary air gap to comply with regulations, but means that the water flowing out of the
            tundish is no longer under pressure and must rely on gravity to reach its destination. For this reason the
            assembly must be at a level higher than the top of the tank that it is supplying; it must also be located
            indoors.The water supply into the tundish is regulated by a solenoid valve which is connected electrically
            to a float switch. As the water level in the tank falls, the float switch drops and opens the solenoid, thus
            allowing the mains water to pass through the tundish into a pipe, which then leads back to the tank. As the
            tank water level rises again, the float switch lifts and shuts off the solenoid. When used with our
            precision float switches, the amount of mains water used in this way is kept to a minimum.Each assembly also
            includes a flexible braided connecting hose for ease of installation, and an isolating valve with integral
            dirt strainer to protect the solenoid valve from any foreign matter. The stainless steel tundish
            incorporates a laminar flow device to ensure that a vertical splash-free column of water passes
            through.These mains top up units can also be used in indirect systems for filling a header or break tank in
            the same way.Five models are available, to fit following pipe sizes: 1/2″, 3/4″, 1″, 11/2″ and 2″</p>
        <hr>

        <img src="img/pro6.jpg" alt="calmed inlets" style="width: 10rem;">
        <h3>CALMED INLETS</h3>
        <p>High quality stainless steel flow-calming inlets designed to smooth the flow of water entering the tank,
            thereby avoiding disturbance of any fine sediments at the bottom of the tank. Fitted to the open end of the
            vertical inlet pipe at the base of the tank, the device also prevents disturbance of any float switch or
            sensor etc.The expanded steel mesh diffuses the flow and forces it upwards into the body of water.Calmed
            inlet diffusers are available to fit 100mm, 150mm and 200mm ID pipes.</p>
        <hr>

        <img src="img/pro7.jpg" alt="float switches" style="width: 15rem;">
        <h3>FLOAT SWITCHES</h3>
        <p>Float Switches are attached to a pivot bracket fitted to a stainless steel mounting clamp. These are designed
            to be fitted to the body of a submersible pump or an appropriate inlet pipe.The on and off levels of the
            switch are precise, as the switch remains in a fixed position. This is particularly useful when the switch
            is controlling the filling levels for topping up a tank with mains water.By limiting the movement of the
            switch, the level of water is easily controlled (typically 90mm level rise), thereby leaving the maximum
            tank volume free to collect the next rainfall event.Switches are normally fitted to the body of a
            submersible pump, or if used within a break tank, fitted to inlet pipework. They available in two
            versions;Red float for dry-run protection (when it drops, it switches the pump off)Yellow float for mains
            water top-up (when it drops, it switches the mains water top-up on, then off again when switch rises.)
            Approximately 9cm difference in water levels between on and off. Could also be used for emptying a
            tank.Switches are available with clamps to to fit 50mm, 100mm and 150mm diameters, and with either 3m, 10m
            or 20m pre-fitted cables.</p>

        <h3>WISY LINEAR FILTERS</h3>
        <p>The new Wisy LineAr Filter is a low-profile in-tank rainwater filter from Wisy AG. Finely engineered from high quality stainless steel, LineAr sets a new standard for in-tank filters with its' 380-micron mesh. The unique design of the filter element exploits the adhesion principle as used in the well-known Wisy Vortex filters. Like the vortex filters, the mesh is a near vertical surface, so debris is easily rinsed off by the action of the flowing water. This gives a vastly improved performance over other in-tank filters that have a near horizontal mesh, which is prone to accumulate leaves and other debris. The LineAr filter is simple to fit and easy to maintain. The long lifting handle allows it to be easily removed from ground level, with no need to enter the tank.</p>

        <h3>WISY VORTEX FILTERS</h3>
        <p>The WISY VORTEX filter is unique with its patented design that uses the principle of adhesion, where water 'sticks' to a smooth surface, in this case the outer layer of a vertical cylinder. This process causes the water to 'pull' through the fine mesh inner layer, leaving behind any leaves, insects and any other particles greater than 0.28mm. The filtered debris then either falls straight through centre of the filter, or is washed off by the action of the flowing water. This unique design avoids the possibility of leaves etc. breaking down on the filter surface or within the tank. This also means that the debris is simply washed away to the storm drain and out of harms way. The VORTEX filter also oxygenates the water to keep quality at its peak and inhibit the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which can cause the water to develop bad odours.</p>

        <h3>HYDRAPRO FILTERS</h3>
        <p>HYDRAPRO FT filters are perfect for use where a low invert loss is required. With a reduced fall of only 80mm between inlet and waste outlet, they can be used in many situations where other filters won't work, and limiting the impact on site drainage levels. It is designed to be installed within a chamber (e.g. concrete rings). Alternatively we can supply the filter already fitted to the underground tank if required. The HYDRAPRO FT filter also incorporates an optional self-cleaning function. Built in to the body of the unit, a laser-cut slot emits an unbroken jet of water across the filter surface, washing any debris into the waste outlet. This significantly reduces maintenance. This function can be simply manually activated or automated using a motorised valve and timer control. (If the system also using a HYDRAPRO control panel this function is built in) Manufactured entirely from 316 stainless steel, the HYDRAPRO filters are versatile and adaptable for a range of installation conditions, and can be used above or below ground. Where required, a stainless steel cover with neoprene seal can be supplied.</p>

        <h3>WISY DOWNPIPE FILTERS</h3>
        <p>Downpipe Filters are the simplest method of collecting rainwater as it flows through the vertical downpipe, and are especially suitable for above-ground tanks. The unique construction of the vertical fine filter rinses dirt particles, leaves, insects etc. away into the drain, leaving clean filtered water to flow into your tank. Once the filter mesh is thoroughly wetted, 95% of the rainwater passes through into the tank. By removing the organic matter, and oxygenating the water, the stored rainwater remains clean and sweet-smelling. Maintenance is quick and easy; the filter element can be simply cleaned with a soft brush, or in the dishwasher.</p>

        <h3>UV DISINFECTION</h3>
        <p>If collected rainwater is to be used in domestic situations for drinking, showers, hand-washing, etc, or commercially in pressure washers for example, it must first be treated in some way. One of the best methods of water disinfection is UV disinfection; it's safe, reliable and energy-efficient. The water to be treated must be free of particles, so it is usually necessary to fit pre-filters before the UV unit. These may consist of wound string cartridges or polypropylene bag filters and will remove all particles down to 5 microns. The rainwater then flows through the UV unit where it pass through a tube surrounded by UV light. The light destroys the DNA of any microorganisms within the water, rendering them harmless. This process is instant, effective and reliable. No chemicals are involved and the taste of the water is not affected. However, UV sterilisation cannot remove discoloration, or any existing bad taste.</p>

        <h3>PRE-UV TREATMENT</h3>
        <p>The process of UV (Ultra Violet) light treatment requires water to pass across a UV lamp. The UV light destroys bacteria and other pathogens in the water in order to make it safe for potable use. This process requires the water to be completely free of particles. Any particles in the water can cast a shadow in which bacteria can still survive, so a very fine pre UV filter is required. Removing the particles prior to UV treatment is fundamental for the process to work. The water must be filtered to 5 microns before it is ready to go through the UV filter. There are a number of different pre UV filter units available, and these can be single, dual or triple stage. The Hydra Rainmaster pre UV filter unit shown has the benefit of a back-washing valve on the first stage that is used to reject the accumulated debris. This can be manually operated, or automated by combining with a solenoid valve and timed power supply.</p>

        <h3>CARBON FILTRATION</h3>
        <p>Carbon filtration is used where taste or odour of a water supply is an issue and can be either a carbon block, or in the form of granular activated carbon. GAC consists of charcoal that has been heated to a very high temperature. Each granule is porous and has a very large surface area (500m2 per gram). As water passes through the charcoal, the granules trap the molecules of pollutants and chemicals that taint the water such as chlorine and volatile organic compounds. Carbon is extremely effective at improving taste, and reducing any smell in water. A GAC or carbon block can be added to a pre UV filter and is worth considering if the water is likely to be consumed. It is recommended that carbon filters should be changed once a year or more frequently where there is any hint of change in smell or taste. Carbon filters do not kill bacteria so are part of the pre treatment process.</p>

        <h3>INSULATED GRP ABOVEGROUND TANKS</h3>
        <p>One-piece or sectional tanks of GRP 'sandwich' construction with up to 50mm insulation, can be used as main storage tanks, or supplied for use as a break tank within a building. Available in a wide range of sizes, capacities from 30 litres to 9,000 litres. Can be built to almost any capacity. For internal use these are most useful where restricted access (e.g. loft hatch or plant room doorway) prohibits the use of a one-piece version. For outdoor use sectional construction enables tanks of almost any size and shape to be built. All sectional tanks include installation, carried out by specialist fitters. Tanks can be supplied fitted with float switches, valve housings and inlet valves. We can also supply drip trays or bunds where required.</p>

        <h3>18L HEADER TANKS</h3>
        <p>A header tank is simply a tank which gives a gravity feed from high level down to WCs and other outlets at a lower level. The pressure from the tank is dependent on the height from the water in the tank to the outlet that it is supplying, so this should be borne in mind. Note: a height of 10m will provide 1 bar (or 14.5 psi) of pressure. 18-litre dual inlet header tank for domestic use. Complete with screened weir overflow and drip-tray. This unit is fitted with two inlet valves, one of which is specially adapted to operate at low level. Requires no power supply as it uses no float switches. It is very compact and is ideal where the system is just supplying WCs.

        <h3>DUAL INLET HEADER TANKS</h3>
        <p>Where a larger capacity is required we have several one-piece pre-fitted polyethylene header tanks with dual inlets and control float switches. These are supplied set-up and ready to install. The two float switches are set at different levels, one to control the pumped rainwater supply, the other controls the mains water back-up supply via a solenoid vavle type AA air gap (tundish). The 112-litre size is ideal for domestic use or small commercial projects supplying up to 10 WCs. The 225L and 450L versions are for larger projects.</p>

        <img src="img/pro34.jpg" alt="2 PUMP FIXED SPEED" style="width: 15rem;">
        <h3>BREAK TANKS</h3>
        <p>A break tank is similar to a header tank but is used in conjunction with a booster set, so does not have to be at a higher level, and is frequently used at ground or basement level in larger buildings. The water is then supplied to the required outlets, having been raised to the required pressure by the booster pump set. Where even larger volumes are required, or where a pre-insulated tank is demanded, we can supply tanks of any size in GRP. These can be fitted with float switches or sensors to control the mains water and rainwater feeds as required. We can also supply tanks with a Keraflo valve fitted into a raised housing on top of the tank. Such tanks can be either single piece or sectional, single or twin compartment, and can be supplied with drip trays.</p>

        <div class="body-info">
            <p>
                <b>Storage Type & Location:</b> <br><br>
                Rainwater harvesting storage is located above ground, below ground, or partially buried. In deciding
                what
                storage is best for you, the key factors are cost and aesthetics. Other factors such as grade, allocated
                space, and underground geology can be a factor as well. <br><br>
                Above ground tanks require the least amount of excavation which can reduce costs dramatically. These can
                be
                hidden behind trees or placed away from the home. Many people also use quality above ground tanks as
                features that complement their landscape design. <br><br>
                Partially buried is a variation in the installation of above-ground tanks, where the tank is placed
                slightly
                in the ground, usually going a quarter to halfway up the tank. <br><br>
                Generally, in-ground tanks require a larger footprint. Excavation costs can be significantly increased
                when
                rock is encountered. In-ground tanks vary in their load-bearing capacity from riding lawn mowers to cars
                to
                semi-trucks. Because it allows the ability to use the space, this is an attractive option for many rain
                harvesters. <br><br>
                Note that precast concrete tanks are limited in size and poured concrete tanks are obsolete. If used,
                concrete tanks should be coated on the inside to protect against deterioration caused by the slightly
                lower
                P.H. of rainwater. These tanks are not suitable for potable water. <br><br>
                Therefore, we highly recommend that all installations should be consider throughoutly. Your system can
                be
                much more efficient and cost less by this method. <br><br>

                <b>For Residential Area:</b> <br><br>
                Harvesting in residential area usually range from small to medium due to need and financial capacity.
                There
                is no need of a big and costly collecting system. We recomend these following products: <br><br>
                Common vessels used for very small-scale water storage in developing countries include plastic bowls and
                buckets, jerry cans, clay or ceramic jars, cement jars, old oil drums, empty food containers, etc. For
                larger quantity a polyethylene tank will do just fine, you can also consider a low profile plastic tank.
                <br><br>
                Pumps in this area is usually the 1 pump type, but you can also consider a 2 pump one. Controller
                doesn<span>&#39;</span>t need to be complicated, just simple buttons and high safety. <br><br>
                Filter can vary based on use, for irrigation, flushing toilet or washing cars, you just need a basic one
                to
                clear out harvested water. To fit for any potable need you will need to spend little or more on some
                devices, choose wisely. <br><br>

                <b>For Commercial Area:</b> <br><br>
                Commercial area harvesting rarely appear in a small range, for long term purpos high durability products
                are
                selected: <br><br>
                An underground system is the most suitable for this area, choose a durable tanks like polyethylene,
                fiberglass, bolted<span>&minus;</span>steel or modular storage, which is the most used in commercial
                applications. <br><br>
                A 2 pump type is require for water to reach its place, controller must be able to control all system and
                safe, filter can vary.
